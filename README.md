# ExcruciatingSufferingsWithLayout
Minimal repro to recreate and fix the HTML/CSS UI of https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/SourceBrowser.

Unfortunately the design of SourceBrowser is terrible. It uses frames, it uses tables. It's not mobile/device friendly.

I want to understand how HTML and CSS layout works to achieve what I want. This repo is the playground for that. There's 0 guarantee that anything useful will graduate from it.

This is all especially painful because I'm intimately familiar with the beauty and brilliance of WPF layout. After that everything else seems like stone age. HTML and CSS are especially painful, knowing how much better it could have been.
